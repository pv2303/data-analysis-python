## Data Playground
Hey, Welcome to Data Analysis's repo, a.k.a, my **data playground**. Here you'll find applications of what I do and how I work with data. You'll find projects ranging from data engineering, analysis and visualization to statistical modeling and prediction using Python. My goal is to show my capacity to understand problems as well as wrap data to answer them by exploring Python libs and capabilities.

In short, these projects will show my ability to:
* **Make the right questions.** Knowing what you need is the key to build a proper analysis.
* **Analyze the data.** From cleaning to visualization and extracting meaninful insights.
* **Tell a story.** Extract from the data a good storytelling.

## Project organization

Each project needs its own solution. However, you will find the following the key elements in each code:
* The dataset - in csv or link or scrapping through the code;
* Notebook - Usually Python Notebooks will tell the story but I may switch to Quarto eventually;
* Visualization - Any graphic, static or animated, will be available either in png or svg. Also, I may do BI visualizations.
